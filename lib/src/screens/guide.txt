-- screens --

The screens folder holds many different folders, 
each of which corresponds to a different screen of the app. 
Each screen folder holds two things: 
a primary screen file and widgets 
which would be used only inside a particular screen 
should be placed inside that screen and not inside the common widgets folder.
